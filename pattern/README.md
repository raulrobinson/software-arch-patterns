# Software Architectural Patterns

Software architectural patterns are general reusable solutions to commonly occurring problems in software architecture within a given context. They are not finished designs but templates that can be applied to solve a particular problem in a specific context. Here are some common software architectural patterns:

1. **Singleton Pattern**: This pattern restricts the instantiation of a class to one single instance. It is used when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system.
2. **Factory Pattern**: This pattern defines an interface for creating an object but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. It is used when a class cannot anticipate the class of objects it must create.
3. **Observer Pattern**: This pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically. It is used when an object needs to notify other objects without making assumptions about who those objects are.
4. **Strategy Pattern**: This pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. It lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it. It is used when you want to define a set of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable.
5. **Decorator Pattern**: This pattern allows behavior to be added to individual objects, either statically or dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class. It is used when you want to add responsibilities to individual objects dynamically and transparently, without affecting other objects.
6. **Adapter Pattern**: This pattern allows incompatible interfaces to work together. It acts as a bridge between two incompatible interfaces. It is used when you want to use an existing class but its interface does not match the one you need.
7. **Facade Pattern**: This pattern provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem. It defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use. It is used when you want to provide a simple interface to a complex system.
8. **Command Pattern**: This pattern encapsulates a request as an object, thereby allowing for parameterization of clients with queues, requests, and operations. It is used when you want to parameterize objects with operations.
9. **Proxy Pattern**: This pattern provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it. It is used when you want to control access to an object, such as lazy initialization, access control, logging, etc.
10. **Template Method Pattern**: This pattern defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a method, deferring some steps to subclasses. It lets subclasses redefine certain steps of an algorithm without changing the algorithm's structure. It is used when you want to define the skeleton of an algorithm in a method, deferring some steps to subclasses.
11. **Builder Pattern**: This pattern separates the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction process can create different representations. It is used when you want to construct a complex object step by step.
12. **Composite Pattern**: This pattern composes objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. It lets clients treat individual objects and compositions uniformly. It is used when you want to represent part-whole hierarchies of objects.
13. **State Pattern**: This pattern allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. The object will appear to change its class. It is used when you want to allow an object to change its behavior when its internal state changes.
14. **Mediator Pattern**: This pattern defines an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact. It promotes loose coupling by keeping objects from referring to each other explicitly, and it lets you vary their interaction independently. It is used when you want to define an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact.
15. **Chain of Responsibility Pattern**: This pattern passes a request along a chain of handlers. Each handler decides either to process the request or to pass it to the next handler in the chain. It is used when you want to pass a request along a chain of handlers.
16. **Visitor Pattern**: This pattern represents an operation to be performed on the elements of an object structure. It lets you define a new operation without changing the classes of the elements on which it operates. It is used when you want to define a new operation without changing the classes of the elements on which it operates.
17. **Bridge Pattern**: This pattern separates an object’s interface from its implementation so that the two can vary independently. It is used when you want to decouple an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently.
18. **Flyweight Pattern**: This pattern uses sharing to support large numbers of fine-grained objects efficiently. It is used when you want to minimize memory usage by sharing common parts of state between multiple objects.
19. **Prototype Pattern**: This pattern creates new objects by copying an existing object, known as the prototype. It is used when the cost of creating a new instance of an object is more expensive than copying an existing instance.
20. **Memento Pattern**: This pattern captures and externalizes an object’s internal state without violating encapsulation, allowing the object to be restored to this state later. It is used when you want to capture and externalize an object’s internal state without violating encapsulation.
21. **Interpreter Pattern**: This pattern defines a representation for a grammar and an interpreter that uses the representation to interpret sentences in the language. It is used when you want to define a grammar for a language and provide an interpreter for it.
22. **Data Access Object (DAO) Pattern**: This pattern provides an abstract interface to some type of database or other persistence mechanism. It is used when you want to separate the data access logic from the business logic.
23. **Repository Pattern**: This pattern mediates between the domain and data mapping layers, acting like an in-memory domain object collection. It is used when you want to separate the logic that retrieves data from the underlying storage system.
24. **Service Layer Pattern**: This pattern defines an application's boundary with a layer of services that establishes a set of available operations. It is used when you want to define a service layer that encapsulates the business logic of the application.
25. **Microservices Pattern**: This pattern structures an application as a collection of loosely coupled services, which implement business capabilities. It is used when you want to build a distributed system that can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.
26. **Event-Driven Architecture Pattern**: This pattern uses events to trigger and communicate between decoupled services. It is used when you want to build a system that reacts to events and can scale independently.
27. **Serverless Architecture Pattern**: This pattern allows developers to build and run applications without managing servers. It is used when you want to build applications that can scale automatically and only pay for the resources you use.
28. **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) Pattern**: This pattern separates the read and write operations of a data store. It is used when you want to optimize the performance, scalability, and security of your application by separating the read and write operations.
29. **Event Sourcing Pattern**: This pattern stores the state of a system as a sequence of events. It is used when you want to capture all changes to an application state as a sequence of events.
30. **Saga Pattern**: This pattern manages distributed transactions by coordinating a series of local transactions. It is used when you want to manage long-running transactions in a distributed system.
31. **Circuit Breaker Pattern**: This pattern prevents an application from repeatedly trying to execute an operation that is likely to fail. It is used when you want to prevent an application from making repeated requests to a service that is likely to fail.
32. **Bulkhead Pattern**: This pattern isolates different parts of a system to prevent a failure in one part from cascading to other parts. It is used when you want to prevent a failure in one part of a system from affecting other parts.
33. **Throttling Pattern**: This pattern limits the number of requests that can be made to a service in a given time period. It is used when you want to prevent a service from being overwhelmed by too many requests.
